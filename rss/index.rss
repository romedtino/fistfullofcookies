Well, hopefully thoughts, stories and ideas.

About what?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fistfulofcookies-romedtino.c9users.io:8080/content/images/2017/11/theo-pup-1.gif" alt="Theo being cute"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Theodore Wylis finds himself surrounded by six mischievous squirrels. For reasons unbeknown to Theo, the squirrels have gathered outside their fluff tree to congregate and attack the almighty Pembroke Welsh Corgi. As he stands in high noon, he gives one final stinky red eye to each squirrel. &lt;s&gt;Draw!&lt;/s&gt; Bite! Didn't even stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who has ever researched getting their own fur ball probably knows they're going to have a jump in expenses but what does owning your pet &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; costs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="upfrontexpenses"&gt;Upfront expenses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h6 id="abreederspawnedmunchkin2000"&gt;A breeder spawned munchkin - &lt;strong&gt;$2000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I spent quite rambunctiously on Theo but for a Southern California resident who was looking for a pure breed Pembroke Welsh Corgi, this seemed like the average price at the time. You might find cheaper going further east of the U.S.A. but you'd go against the possibility of having to fly to the breeder's location and fly your puppy back if the breeder doesn't ship (most reputable breeders don't).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="recurringexpenses"&gt;Recurring expenses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food - Acana Grasslands. $25 for a ~5lbs bag. This usually lasts us about a month. They say it's better to feed your dog GREAT food than get cheap food and have medical costs later. Throw in the occasional treat bag, food chew toys, you're adding maybe an extra $25 every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toys - I think in the span of 4 months I have bought roughly 10~ toys each costing close to $8 a piece. So $80 in 4 months is $20 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grooming - For a corgi once they are a certain age and their double coat is fully fluff, you shouldn't need to go to a groomer often? I'm not certain yet but I hear their double coats help A LOT in terms of keeping dirt out. This probably works against you too in terms of keeping dirt that DOES get in there, stay in there? Trimming nails is the only thing I can fully quantify right now and so far we've done it twice in a span of 4 months each costing $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations - This at the very beginning is very expensive but most of the yearly vaccinations are $35-$50 a year. What I DO pay month to month are the flea/tick prevention. I have been opting on Revolution which comes in 3 month doses for $35 so roughly ~$10 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="optionalexpenses"&gt;&amp;quot;Optional&amp;quot; Expenses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance - I cannot stress how much &lt;strong&gt;I recommend getting insurance&lt;/strong&gt;. More on this below but I use HealthyPaws for insurance and it costs me $41 a month for 80% coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="surpriserighthook"&gt;Surprise Right Hook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short is that Theodore ate a simple seed that fell down from a tree. Swallowed it whole. Eventually he started vomiting and was taken to the E.R. which eventually led to an endoscopy to pull the seed right out of his mouth. So to summarize: Stress, Unplanned doctor visit, Vomiting, Doctor diagnosis, X-Ray, Ultrasound and overnight stay: $4733 prior to insurance. With insurance, ~$750 dollars. Sure, it's still a lot of money but comparing the worst case scenario, THAT IS WAY BETTER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fistfulofcookies-romedtino.c9users.io:8080/content/images/2017/11/theo-sad.jpg" alt="Theo sad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="time"&gt;Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot costs doesn't necessarily equate easily to actual cash. Some of it is a loss of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having to go to the groomers or the vet instead of binge watching the latest episodes of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty sure walks are healthy for me and I probably at least do over an hours worth of walks everyday now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also spend at least 30 minutes to an hour regularly playing games with the dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The various minutes spent preventing the puppy from doing what it shouldn't be doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The various minutes spent convincing the puppy from doing what it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sacrifices"&gt;Sacrifices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot sacrifices to be had as well. It's not easy to go somewhere far without having a plan for your furry friend. For example, if I want to go on vacation that involves a plane ride, it's not as easy as packing up my bags and leaving anymore. I have to decide is my furry friend coming along if so, how much will the airline charge for the dog? Is that airline notorious for mishandling pets? Should I just board him at a reputable place? How much will it cost?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even simple things such as hanging out with friends have its challenges. I cannot stay out &lt;em&gt;too late&lt;/em&gt; especially if I still need to feed my dog. I have to coordinate a lot more diligently with friends as opposed to agreeing on a sporadic meet as I am accustomed to.&lt;br&gt;
Being with friends&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whatareyougettingoutofit"&gt;What are you getting out of it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's truly an investment. An investment not for everyone. A lot of studies show that having a companion such as a dog has good implications for your health such as potentially living longer. Honestly though, I do it cause I find corgis ridiculously irresistible. Granted, I did not know &lt;em&gt;how much work&lt;/em&gt; it actually involves but if you look at this guy, how can you not want to just play with it!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fistfulofcookies-romedtino.c9users.io:8080/content/images/2017/11/theo-happy.jpg" alt="Theo happy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely want to note that &lt;em&gt;these are my experiences so far of owning my puppy&lt;/em&gt; and isn't necessarily the average case. Heck, you might have a &lt;strong&gt;TOTALLY&lt;/strong&gt; different experience from myself (hopefully for the better!) but the idea is to maybe give you a slightly detailed version of what you'd expect from owning a little gnawing piranha :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: I honestly thought I was going to make this a HUGE blog post but then I got lazy. :D Hopefully though it has enough content for you to reconsider or accept the potential costs of owning a pet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes I do.

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes I do. Although, I had no idea where to start (even though there's thousands of resources on &lt;a href="http://fistfulofcookies-romedtino.c9users.io:8080/ghostgithubcloud9/www.lmgtfy.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;). I know I wanted &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; hosting because I am beyond cheap. I know I wanted the website to at least have SSL because you owe it to yourself to have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; level of &lt;s&gt;dignity&lt;/s&gt; security. Hey, cool! &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; has exactly what I am looking for! Now what blog service do I turn to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean you probably have heard of a plethora of different &lt;em&gt;blog services&lt;/em&gt; such as Xanga or LiveJournal just to name a few of the more popular ones ;). However, the ones that caught my eye when I was perusing the depths of the internet were Tumblr, WordPress, Blogger, Jekyll and Ghost. If you can't tell, I did opt for Ghost for these reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr&lt;/strong&gt; - There's just too much going on here and I can't take it seriously. I understand&lt;br&gt;
the reasons why &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; people choose Tumblr (questionable if that was Tumblr's initial intention) and it's really more of getting away from the blog mentality with just sharing images, a quick prose or something that doesn't necessarily need to be chunky. In this day and age where people want their information quick and gritty, Tumblr has your back. Also for my use case, certain proxies I have played with for some reason like to block Tumblr so that's just a no go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress&lt;/strong&gt; - WordPress by WordPress**.org** is actually pretty nice but it seems really heavy and cumbersome. I wanted something &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; simple (even though I have probably convoluted my process) but also customizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogger&lt;/strong&gt; - You have to tie this to a Google account and even though I almost have &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; tied to Google, I wanted to go a different route. Blogger is also pretty different where in that you don't have the ability to host the server on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt; - You can host on your own, it is open source, it is &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; for actually generating blogs or static pages, so why did I not choose Jekyll? Honestly, it's because I tried Ghost first and haven't had the chance to try Jekyll. Also, I have used Node.js before and not really Ruby so I didn't want to learn something on top of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost&lt;/strong&gt; - Looks cool, decent documentation and examples to get started, and it doesn't seem too hard to set up. Let's do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="creatingyourblog"&gt;Creating your blog&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages is awesome. It's a place where you can host static data for either a project or in our case, a blog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a GitHub Pages site &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;using these directions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: Try to use your main account for your blog or prepare to be savvy and do some cleanup before posting your blog (e.g. if your GitHub username is benfranklin, host with your main github pages: &lt;code&gt;benfranklin.github.io&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to &lt;code&gt;benfranklin.github.io/bensblogaboutbells&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave it blank for now and there's no need to apply any theme since you're most likely going to find your own Ghost theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C9.io&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.c9.io/nc-3.1.3702-b43a5b7f-wf/static/plugins/c9.profile/static/images/cloud9-logo.svg" alt="C9.io awesome!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud9 is also awesome. It's literally a free online linux workspace you can almost do anything with. I have used it to debug/create my &lt;a href="https://romedtino.github.io"&gt;personal website&lt;/a&gt; as well as test my &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.expandedlabs.kingscupcast&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Chromecast app - Kings Cup Cast&lt;/a&gt;. Both so far have been &lt;code&gt;javascript&lt;/code&gt; but you can do A LOT more from &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Java&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Python&lt;/code&gt;, etc. The only scary thing here is that they initially ask you for a credit card despite having a free version so watch out for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://c9.io/"&gt;https://c9.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new workspace BUT don't tie it to your GitHub account just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C9.io uses Node.js! but by default it uses v4 while you'll need at least 6. So go ahead and get those and set it as default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm install 6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;nvm alias default 6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.cmscritic.com/site/assets/files/5805/ghost_logo_big.png" alt="Ghost.org"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can cheat and just install it via  &lt;code&gt;npm install ghost&lt;/code&gt; BUT for some reason I went the hard way and compiled it from source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/developers/"&gt;https://ghost.org/developers/&lt;/a&gt; and grab the zip. By the time of my writing it was &lt;code&gt;wget https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/releases/download/1.0.2/Ghost-1.0.2.zip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unzip Ghost*.zip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --production&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you run into any conflicts (I know I did, feel free to just &lt;code&gt;npm uninstall&lt;/code&gt; that dependency and use the one Ghost needs. If you need that specific version, then why are you using the same c9 workspace?! :O Make a new one!) You might also need &lt;code&gt;apt get python-devel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once ghost is installed, you would have to edit &lt;code&gt;ghost/config.js&lt;/code&gt; for cloud 9 specificities that deal with &amp;quot;localhost&amp;quot; and ghosts default URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change &lt;code&gt;http//url: 'http://localhost:2368'&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;url: 'https://' + process.env.C9_HOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change &lt;code&gt;host: '127.0.0.1'&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;host: process.env.IP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change &lt;code&gt;port: 2368&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;port: process.env.PORT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you're all set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running Ghost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once ghost is up and running, simply do &lt;code&gt;npm start&lt;/code&gt; and hopefully ghost starts running! Just simply visit your &lt;code&gt;https://WORKSPACE-USERNAME.c9users.io&lt;/code&gt; and you should see a Ghost Splash screen! Then just visit &lt;code&gt;https://WORKSPACE-USERNAME.c9users.io/ghost&lt;/code&gt; to login.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="publishingtogithub"&gt;Publishing to GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've gotten your blog all nice and nifty, now you want to publish it to your GitHub page. What's nice about c9 is that it also comes with Python pre-installed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install this nifty tool someone made that transcribes Ghost blogs into static pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install buster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you're ready to summon the GitHub page you had previously created. I decided to put mine within the ghost installation as this makes the next few steps easier (less command line arguments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:username/username.github.io.git static&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now let buster generate the static pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;buster generate --domain=https://WORKSPACE-USERNAME.c9users.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then deploy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;buster deploy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If things worked out correctly, it should have checked it all in your GitHub page! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="addressingrandomproblems"&gt;Addressing random problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem: You decided to use a project page as opposed to your main page on GitHub to host your blog.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had this exact problem. &lt;code&gt;buster&lt;/code&gt; unfortunately, is not perfect. Currently my &lt;code&gt;/content&lt;/code&gt; directory assumes it sits in the root but this isn't always the case (e.g. &lt;code&gt;http://username.github.io/myawesomeblog/content&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution is pretty hacky for my taste but for now, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sed -i 's:=&amp;quot;/content:=&amp;quot;/myawseomeblog/content:' ./static/index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yea, it's a &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; command and I kind of don't like it since I am post processing the output which makes me question if my approach was worth it. I did wrap most of these in my &lt;code&gt;bash_aliases&lt;/code&gt; to save more time. Nevertheless, it all seems to work! :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;
